# Tennis Score Board

## Happy Birthday Dad !
Because we can't play tennis on your birthday, we thought we would have a mini tournament at home. And any tournament would be incomplete without a scoreboard. I threw this together in an hour last night, so there are still likely to be many bugs if not used exactly as intended. I may fix them later for future tournaments.

##Controls
### Inputing Player Names
I have added so keycodes representing players in our family, if more players want to be added they must choose a keycode and I can add it to the list. In future I will make this process a lot easier.
##### Player codes

```
a = Alex
m = Lucy
d = Anthony
e = Emma
s = Sophie
```

##### Game Controls
```
r = reset match
< = increase left players score
> = increase right players score 
```
