# Tennis Score Board

## Happy Birthday Dad !
Because we can't play tennis on your birthday, we thought we would have a mini tournament at home. And any tournament would be incomplete without a scoreboard. I threw this together in an hour last night, so there are still likely to be many bugs if not used exactly as intended. I may fix them later for future tournaments.

## Controls
### Inputing Player Names
I have added so keycodes representing players in our family, if more players want to be added they must choose a keycode and I can add it to the list. In future I will make this process a lot easier.
#### Player codes

```
a = Alex
m = Lucy
d = Anthony
e = Emma
s = Sophie
```

#### Game Controls
```
r = reset match
< = increase left players score
> = increase right players score 
```

## How to Use
To use this program you must download Processing to compile and display the scoreboard. Then clone this repo or download files. Make sure you download all data files and put everything inside a folder labeled <u><b>tennisScoreboard</u></b>
